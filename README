		Metro

The Metro tool measures the distance between two discrete surfaces described as
triangular meshes. The topology of the meshes needs not be the same, arbitrary
topologies can be compared.

To compile the program the QT libraries, version 2.3.0 or later with the
support OpenGL compiled in, are required. The QTDIR environment variable
should point to the QT installation directory.

Type 'make all' at the command prompt and the executable, viewer, will be
installed in the ./bin directory. To get a command line syntax, type
'./bin/viewer -h' at the command line prompt. The current Makefile requires
GNU make and supports Linux (with GCC) and IRIX (with the MIPSPro
compilers). Other systems might require some modifications.

The input file format for the triangular meshes is a raw ASCII format, which
describes the vertices, the vertex connectivity and optionally the vertex
normals. The first line should contain two or three decimal numbers with the
number of vertices, the number of triangles and the number of vertex normals
(if they are present). If the vertex normals are present, their number must
equal the number of vertices. Follow the X, Y, Z affine coordinates for each
vertex and then the indices of the three vertices of each triangular face. The
vertex indices are zero based. If the vertex normals are given follows the X,
Y, Z affine coordinates of the vertex normal vectorss, in the same order as
the vertices. The normal vectors should all be normalized.
